## Introduction

Scannly - Expiry Date Tracker ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

Scannly is designed with privacy as a core principle. All data you create within the app is stored locally on your device only.

## Data Storage

All information you enter into Scannly, including:
- Product names and descriptions
- Expiry dates
- Photos or scanned images
- Notification preferences
- Any other data you input

...is stored exclusively on your device's local storage. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party services.

## Camera and Photo Access

Scannly requires access to your device's camera to:
- Scan expiry dates using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Scan product barcodes
- Take photos of products

All images captured through the app are processed and stored locally on your device. We do not upload, share, or transmit these images anywhere.

## Notifications

Scannly uses local notifications to remind you about expiring products. These notifications are generated on your device and do not involve any data transmission to external servers.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your information with third parties because we do not collect or have access to your information.

## Export and Import Feature

Scannly allows you to export your data for backup purposes and import it to restore your inventory. This export/import functionality:
- Creates a local file on your device
- Does not upload data to any cloud service
- Gives you full control over your data backups

Any sharing of exported data is entirely at your discretion through your device's sharing capabilities.

## Third-Party Services

Scannly uses the following services and technologies:

**On-Device Processing:**

- **Google ML Kit Barcode Scanning**: Processes barcodes locally on your device

**Optional Internet Services:**
- When you scan a barcode, the app may optionally look up product information from a third-party service. Only the barcode number is sent - no personal information, photos, or other data is transmitted. This feature requires an internet connection and can fail if you're offline.

**What We DON'T Use:**
- No analytics or tracking services
- No advertising networks
- No data collection for marketing purposes

## Children's Privacy

Scannly does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is rated 4+ and suitable for all ages.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- You can delete any item at any time within the app
